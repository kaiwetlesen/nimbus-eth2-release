# Nimbus Eth2 Client RPM Build

Nimbus Eth2 is a combination beacon chain and validator client (formerly
Ethereum/2) which is incredibly lightweight. It can run on hardware as
small as a Raspberry Pi or as large as a full server. This package is
designed to cooperate nicely with the [Erigon2](https://github.com/kaiwetlesen/erigon2-release)
package, providing a full merge-capable Ethereum software suite.

In addition to all options provided by Nimbus, this package provides
both SystemD and FirewallD specifications so that the modern RedHat node
operator can easily and quickly get up and running.

Visit the [COPR Page](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kwetlesen/nimbus-eth2/)
for Nimbus installation and configuration instructions, including how to
pair Nimbus up with Erigon2.
