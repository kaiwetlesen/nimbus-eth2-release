  <short>Nimbus Eth2</short>
  <description>
    These services are the recommended set of services which should be open to
    operate a fully functional Nimbus Consensus (a.k.a. Eth2) client. This
    currently includes all ports to operate the peering mechanisms, as well as
    the REST endpoint. Enable these ports to run Nimbus Eth2 in a default
    configuration.

    Note: those operating a public facing Nimbus node may prefer to proxy or
    otherwise restrict access to the REST services as running Nimbus nodes
    represents a considerable investment. For those persons, it is recommended
    to enable the `nimbus-eth2-peering` service only and let the REST services
    reside behind the firewall.
