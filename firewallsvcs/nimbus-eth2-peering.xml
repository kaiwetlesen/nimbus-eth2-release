  <short>Nimbus Eth2 Peering</short>
  <description>
    This service enables the Nimbus Eth2 client to establish typical
    peer-to-peer connections. This currently includes peer-to-peer connections
    with other Ethereum2-compatible consensus clients. Enable these ports for
    any system which will participate in an Ethereum-compatible network which
    provides state snapshots.
